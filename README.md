APIs:

Google Maps API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation - Potentially used in addition to Mapbox to provide GPS navigation, but still up in the air.

Mappbox API - https://docs.mapbox.com/api/ - Highly customizable map data; will revert to Google Maps API as backup.

OpenWeatherMap API - https://openweathermap.org/api - Compile live weather data.

National park service API - https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.html - data on national parks, including details, alerts, news and events - ** This is the main API I will be using, and I will either choose to optionally implement the others following it or will stick with this.
